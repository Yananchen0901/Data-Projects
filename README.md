# VBA-for-financial-data-collection
VBA for retrieving data from the Wall Street Journal Website

These user-defined functions would only work for this data entry template on Macbook. Becasue Macbook is not able to proceed web query, I can only pull data per website and do the data collection accordingly. 
For example,I can only copy data from the income statement website and then use the pull_incomedata function to get the data into the template.
