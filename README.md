# VBA-for-financial-data-collection
VBA for retrieving data from the Wall Street Journal Website

These user-defined functions would only work for this data entry template on Macbook. Becasue Macbook is not able to proceed web query, I can only pull data per website and do the data collection accordingly. 
For example,I can only copy data from the income statement website and then use the pull_incomedata function to get the income data into the template.

There are two sheets in the excel file, one is called the "Web Data" which allows VBA to retrive and copy data into the template.
